# 🍽️🌍 Big Data Analysis of Global Food Availability Using FAO Food Balance Sheets in Hive

Welcome to this exciting project that dives deep into the global food supply landscape through powerful big data analytics using Apache Hive and Python! 🚀📊

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

As the global population surges and climate patterns shift, understanding food availability worldwide is critical. This project leverages **FAO Food Balance Sheets** data combined with Hive-powered analytics to uncover trends, disparities, and growth patterns in food supply at the global scale. 🌾🍅🥕

By connecting Hive queries with Python analysis in Jupyter Notebook, we provide actionable insights for policymakers, researchers, and food security advocates. 🎯🤝
